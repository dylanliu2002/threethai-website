Task Key: sys-auto-001-codex-autonomous-workflow-bootstrap
Task ID: SYS-AUTO-001
Role: ORCHESTRATOR
Task: Codex Autonomous Workflow Bootstrap
Branch: codex/sys-auto-001-bootstrap
Commit: not committed
Date: 2026-09-04

Work Log:
- Recorded the user's explicit SYS-AUTO-001 authorization before implementation.
  The former proposal name Task 53 is retired and is not used as machine identity.
- Fetched origin and created the dedicated branch/worktree from exact current
  main `b18e5630909e73c3fc6b4884a51d0b6daa89d20c`; no existing branch/worktree was
  reset, stashed, deleted or reused.
- Confirmed Task 52 is merged in the base and its shared task-board write
  ownership was released. No existing Task is adopted or launched.
- Read workspace/repository governance and all prospective shared artifacts.
  Recorded the HIGH-risk manual-supervision and separate activation gates.
- Checked installed Codex CLI `0.153.0-alpha.5` and official OpenAI docs. Native
  non-interactive JSONL, output-schema, sandbox, cwd, AGENTS.md and Skill
  capabilities support a small CLI adapter; App Server is deferred.

Stage Summary:
- Status IN_PROGRESS / phase IMPLEMENT. Implement only the allowlisted bootstrap,
  validate deterministic dry-run behavior, then deliver REVIEW without PR,
  activation, worker dispatch, task adoption, merge or production changes.
